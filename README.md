# Python-Pomodoro-App
This app implements the Pomodoro Technique, created by Francesco Cirillo for a more productive way to work and study. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks (5 minutes). Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student. After 4 work session it allows a long break of about 20 minutes.
